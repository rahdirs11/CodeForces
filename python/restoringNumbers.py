'''
Polycarp has guessed three positive integers a, b and c. He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order â€” 
their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order: a + b, a + c, b + c and a + b + c.

You have to guess three numbers a, b and c using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.

Pay attention that some given numbers can be equal.
